	<h3>Program Preferences</h3>

	<p> The preferences dialog can be opened by the toolbar or
	through the "Program" menu. The dialog is divided into seven tabs
	described in the following text.  </p>

	<h4>Feed Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_feeds_1.14.0.png">
	</p>
	<ul>

	<li>
	<b>Feed Cache Handling:</b> Here you can set the default number
	of items to be saved for each subscription. Note that this setting
	can be overwritten for each subscription by setting the item cache
	size in the subscriptions properties.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Feed Update Settings:</b> Here you can set the default refresh
	interval for all subscriptions. Note that this setting can be
	overwritten for each subscription by setting the refresh interval
	in the subscriptions properties.<br>
	<p>
	The "Update all subscription at startup" check box allows you to
	control the update behaviour right after startup.
	</p>
	</li>

	</ul>

	<h4>Folder Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_folders_1.14.0.png">
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
	<b>Folder Display Settings:</b> With these check boxes you can control
	what Liferea loads into the item list when you click a folder.
	The default behaviour is to load all unread items and to hide all items
	you've already read.
	</p>
	<p>
	Usually you will want to enable both options as this allows to quickly read through all unread
	items of a set of feeds.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Feed Icons (Favicons):</b> This button allows you to trigger
	an update of all favicons of all subscriptions.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Headline Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_headlines_1.14.0.png">
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Reading Headlines:</b> Here you can set the hotkey for skimming
	through all unread headlines.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Default View Mode</b> Select your favourite viewing mode here.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b> Use fixed width date format.</b> Date and time in the headline are displayed in 
	a fixed width form.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Defer removing read items from folders and search folders</b>
	When reading items from a folder or search folder, like 'Unread',
	defer removing the items from the UI until you leave the folder. 
	This allows re-reading read items or marking them unread. Read 
	items appear in light-weight font.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Web Integration:</b> Here you can configure your favourite
	social bookmarking website. This setting is used when you invoke
	"Post Bookmark" from the item context menu or the HTML view.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<a name="browser">
	<h4>Browser Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_browser_1.14.0.png">
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Internal Browser Settings:</b> Here you can configure three
	things. First you can specify whether
	or not Liferea should open clicked links in the configured
	external browser or in the internal browser. The second option
	allows you to switch off Javascript. The third option allows you
	to enable browser plugins.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>External Browser Settings:</b> When you click links in a
	article you read Liferea launches a browser command you can
	define with this preferences. The first option button is to
	select your favourite browser or "Manual" for a user defined
	browser command. With the second option button you specify
	how the link is opened inside the previously selected browser.<br>
	<br>
	Only when selecting "Manual" as browser you can enter a
	browser command in the command entry. When entering a command
	don't forget to include a <i>"%s"</i> within the command which
	will be replaced with the URL that was clicked. Please keep in
	mind to double quote the place holder to avoid shell problems
	with the hash character (#) when launching the browser.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Desktop Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_desktop_1.14.0.png">
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Toolbar Settings:</b> Here you can select whether you want to
	display both menu bar and tool bar or only one of them. Additionally
	can influence the toolbar button detail.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Other:</b> Here you can choose wether you want to have a safety
	confirmation when marking all items read.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Proxy Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_proxy_1.14.0.png">
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>HTTP Proxy Server:</b> Here you can specify how Liferea
	should determine the proxy configuration. The suggested default
	configuration is to figure it out automatically from the
	environment variables and the GNOME configuration.
	<br />
	<br />
	If Liferea incorrectly detects the proxy or you want to configure
	a different proxy then you should use the "No Proxy" or "Manual Setting"
	option.
	<br />
	<br />
	There is currently no direct SOCKS support. For a SOCKS proxy use
	"Auto Detect" and configure your global desktop (GNOME, KDE...) to use SOCKS!
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Enclosures Preferences</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_prefs_enclosures_1.14.0.png">
	</p>

	<p>
	This tab allows you to configure how Liferea should handle
	enclosures. If you are still unsure what enclosures are
	about please read the <a href="enclosures_en.html">Enclosures/Podcasting</a>
	section first.
	</p>

	<a name="enclosures">

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Downloading Enclosures:</b> Here you specify which download
	tool Liferea should use.
	<br/><br/>
	When you have problems downloading enclosures please ensure
	you have installed the configured download tool and that it is
	working correctly when you run it on the command line.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Opening Enclosures:</b> Using the "Properties" and "Delete" button
	you can edit the list of known enclosures types. Typically you only
	want to do this if you want to remove or change program associations.
	You don't need to create this definitions manually because Liferea
	will create a new one and ask you which program to use when you
	open or save a type of enclosures.
