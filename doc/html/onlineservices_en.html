	<h3>What is TheOldReader and TinyTinyRSS?</h3>
	<p>
	TheOldReader (<a href="http://theoldreader.com/">http://theoldreader.com/</a>) and
	TinyTinyRSS (<a href="http://tt-rss.org/">http://tt-rss.org/</a>)
	are <b>online news aggregators</b>. To use these services you need an online user account.
	With such an account you can read your subscriptions
	<ul>
		<li>from Liferea</li>
		<li>using any web browser on any PC</li>
		<li>or using a smartphone app</li>
	</ul>
	which means you can read your news simply from everywhere you are.
	</p>

	<h3>Why Using an Online News Aggregator with Liferea?</h3>
	<p>
	Liferea as a desktop aggregator cannot provide the global accessibility
	that a online news aggregator provides. While you can access an online
	aggregator from virtually everywhere, Liferea needs to be installed and configured
	on every PC you use. Also it ensures no direct synchronisation between the
	different installations.
	</p>
	<p>
	Using an online aggregator you can workaround this situation. You can subscribe
	to your online account from all your Liferea installations and
	will have synchronous feed lists and item states everywhere. At the same
	time you can still use a web browser to log in to the online aggregator directly
	if you are at a public terminal for example.
	</p>

	<h3>How to Subscribe</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Create a online aggregator account if you not already have one.</li>
		<li>Click "New/New Source" and select "TheOldReader" or "TinyTinyRSS" from the dialog.</li>
		<li>Enter you account username and password.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	Shortly after subscribing the feed list of your online account
	should appear and items should be retrieved.
	</p>

	<h4>Google Reader</h4>
	<p>
	Until 01.07.2013 Google did provide the "Google Reader" service which
	Liferea was able to import into the subscription list.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you still have the "Google Reader" subscriptions in Liferea you can
	convert them into normal Liferea feeds. To achieve this select the
	"Convert To Local Subscriptions" option in the subscription context menu.
	<b>The advantage of converting is that Liferea can keep all downloaded
	headline for further use and while fetching new headlines.</b>
	</p>

	<h4>TheOldReader</h4>
	<p>
	Using "TheOldReader" requires an existing user account with this online
	service. For this user account <b>having a password is mandatory!</b>
	You can set a password on <a href="http://theoldreader.com/">http://theoldreader.com</a>
	under "Preferences".
	<p>
	If you chose "TheOldReader" as source you need to provide user name and
	password of your online account. After doing so Liferea will provide
	you with the subscription list fetched from "TheOldReader".
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Note:</b> If you delete "TheOldReader" subscriptions or headlines
	in Liferea then those will <b>also</b> be deleted in the online service
	"TheOldReader"!
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Note:</b> "TheOldReader" doesn't support synchronizing the flagging
	of important headlines. If you flag an item in Liferea, this flag will
	only be visible in Liferea. The same is true for "TheOldReader" if you
	"like" an headline this won't be visible in Liferea.
	</p>

	<h3>TinyTinyRSS</h3>

	<p>Liferea 1.10 and later supports TinyTinyRSS versions starting with
	version 1.5.3.</p>

	<p>TinyTinyRSS must be installed on your own server, which requires server
	administration knowledge. Once installed, TinyTinyRSS behaves as any other
	online service.</p>
