	<p>
	This section describes how to organize subscriptions into folders.
	</p>

	<h4>The Feed List Icons</h4>
	<table cellspacing="10">

	<tr><td valign="top"><img src="help_folder.png"></td><td>
	This icon or a similar icon (because it's GTK theme dependant) is the standard icon for folders.
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><img src="help_feed_default.png"></td><td>
	This is the standard icon for subscriptions. Note that Liferea supports
	individual icons provided by a "favicon.ico" file on the webserver.
	Liferea always tries to download this file and use it instead of the
	default icon.
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><img src="help_opml.png"></td><td>
	This is the standard icon for OPML subscriptions.
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td valign="top"><img src="help_feed_error.png"></td><td>
	This icon or a similar icon (because it's GTK theme dependant) may
	indicate on of the following conditions:
	<ul>
	<li>That the subscription was not yet downloaded.</li>
	<li>That the last retrieval failed.</li>
	<li>That the content of the feed is mal-formed.</li>
	</ul>
	</td></tr>
	</table>

	<h4>How to Update Subscriptions</h4>

	<p>There are three possibilities to update a feed:
	<ul>
	<li>Select "Update All" from the "Subscriptions" menu.</li>
	<li>Select "Update Feed" after right-clicking a subscriptions in the feed list.</li>
	<li>Select "Update Folder" after right-clicking one of the folders the feed is child of.</li>
	</ul>
	But the best way might be to use none of the above. Just let Liferea
	update your subscription periodically. To learn	more about updating
	read the section on <a href="updating_en.html">Updating Subscriptions</a>.</p>

	<h4>How to Change the Properties of a Subscription</h4>
	<p>
	To change the properties of a subscription (the title, the
	source URL, the update interval and cache settings) either
	select "Properties" from the context menu by right clicking
	the feed in the feed list or selecting "Properties" from the
	"Feed" menu.  The properties dialog will then appear. The
	settings of the properties dialog are described in the
	<a href="subscriptions_en.html#properties">Managing Subscriptions</a> section.
	</p>

	<h4>How to Remove a Subscription or Folder</h4>

	<p>To remove a feed or folder, just select the "Delete" option
	either from the feed list context menu or the "Feed" menu
	after selecting the feed list's entry to delete. When removing
	feeds, this will remove the feed and all of its cached
	contents.</p>

	<h4>How to Reorder Folder Contents</h4>

	<p> To reorder feed list elements simply drag them with the mouse
	and drop them into their new destination. A little line is shows
	where the destination will be while dragging a feed or folder.</p>
