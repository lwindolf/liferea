    <release date="2024-06-20" version="1.15.7">
      <description>
        <p>This is a release introducing some changes. First there is a new privacy setting you can
        enable: additionally to Do-Not-Track Liferea now supports the Do-Not-Sell user data setting.</p>
        <p>There is a major change to the enclosure (media attachments) handling. The build in media player
        working on a "attachment" style list view under the item content was removed. Now enclosures
        are added via HTML audio and video tags below the item content. The idea is to play those
        purely with WebkitGTK support. Downloading is still supported by right clicking on those tags.</p>
        <p>Finally a long standing issue was improved: when a feed does not provide item titles Liferea now
        uses a teaser of the item content as the title. This for example fixes the usability of Mastodon feeds.</p>
        <p>Changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add Sec-GPC header support via new preference to prevent user data selling (Lars Windolf)</li>
          <li>Drop enclosure list view in favour of embedded HTML5 audio and video elements (Lars Windolf)</li>
          <li>Fixes #1332: Improve "*** No title! ***" for items without title (Lars Windolf)</li>
          <li>Update appdata for 1.15.6 by (bbhtt)</li>
          <li>appdata: Update screenshot captions and remove dead link by (bbhtt)</li>
          <li>Allow building with libsoup 3.0.7 by (ittner)</li>

          <li>Automatically set inline SVG sizes from viewBox attribute to prevent max-width SVGs</li>
          <li>Hide <code> nav </code> elements extracted by HTML5 content extraction</li>

        <p>This release brings small improvements to the trayicon plugin and content filtering

      <description>
        <p>This release brings small fixes and a rework of the trayicon plugin</p>
        <p>Thanks to the work of Yuri Konotopov the trayicon plugin now supports AppIndicator
        and libayatana. The important difference here is that the new item counter can be shown
        as a text label next to the icon which makes for much improved rendering.</p>
        <p>There are some limitations though as AppIndicator might not work perfect in all implementations
        (e.g. XFCE).</p>
        <p>Changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve on #1192 by doing pane sanity checks on each resize (Lars Windolf)</li>
          <li>Fixes #1297: Reorder loading plugins and deactivating webkit-settings (Lars Windolf)</li>

      <description>
        <p>This is a new feature release. It introduces the long awaited switch to libsoup3 and libwebkit2gtk-4.1.
        Thanks to many testers helping testing the latest code from git some errors were ironed out already. Still there is an issue remaining where feed updates are getting stuck when updating while DNS resolution/Wifi/network... fails. Please comment if you also experience this issue! Also noteworthy is a simplification of the debug handling which removes three CLI parameters --debug-performance, --debug-trace and --debug-verbose</p>

    </release>
    <release date="2022-07-26" version="1.13.9">
      <description>
        <p>This will be the last unstable release before the first 1.14 release candidate. It contains
         bugfixes and a generalization of the Google Reader API implementation we already had
         for TheOldReader. This implementation was improved, fixing some bugs and can now
         be used with arbitrary Google Reader services.
        </p>
        <p>New features: Google Reader API support

           If you are a FeedHQ, FreshRSS, Basquz user or a a user of any other Google Reader
           compatible service, you can now subscribe to those services.

           Note: it currently doesn't work with Miniflux due to this miniflux/v2#1498
           which is probably a bug in Miniflux. Once it is solved Miniflux also can be used.

           If you experience any issues please open a ticket for support!
        </p>
        <p>GUI simplification: less cluttered item list

           The item list has seen some rework. The quite large left padding (cause by reserved space
           for expansion header) is now gone. Also the enclosures icon column was dropped. When
           using Liferea in wide mode this really gives back a lot of vertical space, so Liferea in wide mode
           becomes more useful half-maximized or in split screen situations.

           Please give feedback how you like the change, especially the rather small padding left of the
           favicon column (when in wide mode)!
        </p>
        <p>Changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Update to Readability.js 0.41 (better image and table handling) (Lars Windolf)</li>
          <li>Changes to UserAgent handling: same UA is now used for both feed fetching
                and internal browsing. User agent now indicates Android+Mobile per default
                instead of suggesting a Linux desktop to better adapt to the smaller
                (in comparison to browsers) rendering pane. Additionally special env
                vars LIFEREA_UA and LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS now also affect the internal
                browsing.</li>
          <li>Improve HTML5 extraction: extract main if it exists and no article was found</li>
          <li>#1117: Hide unused expander space in item list. This saves horizontal space. (Sefler Zhou)</li>
          <li>Drop enclosure icon from item list. This saves horizontal space. (Lars Windolf)</li>
          <li>#515, #962, #1113 adds generic Google Reader API support (this enables access to FeedHQ, FreshRSS, Miniflux...)</li>
          <li>#1108, #113: Improve performance by different check order in itemset merging (suggested by mozbugbox)</li>
          <li>Fixes #1033: Subscribing defaulted to HTML5 feeds even when real feeds do exist. (reported by Hanno Braun)</li>
          <li>Fixes #1111: wrong base URI in reader mode (Lars Windolf)</li>
          <li>Fixes #1112: Image duplication caused by feeds providing an image link which is also in the item description as additional metadata. (Lars Windolf)</li>
          <li>Update of Dutch translation (Gert-dev)</li>
