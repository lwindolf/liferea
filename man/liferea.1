.SH DBUS INTERFACE
To allow integration with other programs \fBLiferea\fP provides a DBUS
interface for automatic creation of new subscriptions. The script
\fBliferea-add-feed\fP is a convenient way to use this interface. Just
pass a valid feed URL as parameter and the feed will be added to the
feed list. You can also pass non-feed URLs to use feed auto discovery.
See the EXAMPLES section.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B http_proxy (for HTTP connections)
.RE
.B https_proxy (for HTTPS connections)
.RS
If defined and a proxy is not specified in the \fBLiferea\fP preferences (which
uses the proxy settings provided by dconf), their value will be used as proxy
URIs. Both are used by many common CLI tools, so make sure to export them in a
dedicated subshell.
.RE
.TP
.B LIFEREA_FEED_CMD_TIMEOUT
.RS
If defined, overrides the default timeout for feed generating commands with
the number of seconds given in this variable. It must be an integer value
greater than zero; invalid values will be ignored.
.RE
.TP
.B LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS
If defined, randomizes and anonymizes the default HTTP/S User-Agent string.
.RB
.TP
.B LIFEREA_UA
If defined, its value replaces the default HTTP/S User-Agent string.
.RB
.LP
LIFEREA_UA has always precedence over LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS, so the latter can
be safely defined in global shell initialization files.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.nf
$ http_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:3128" liferea
.fi
.RE
.nf
$ http_proxy="http://username:password@proxy.example.com:3128" liferea
.fi
.RS
Will alter each outgoing request to use proxy.example.com on port 3128 as
proxy. If DNS resolution does not work, an IP address can be used instead.
.RE
.TP
.nf
$ LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS=1 liferea --debug-net
.fi
Will alter each outgoing HTTP/S request to randomize \fBLiferea\fP's version and
hide the operative system in use.
In addition, prints the HTTP/S User-Agent and all outgoing network requests.
.RB
.TP
.nf
$ LIFEREA_UA="Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0" liferea

.fi
.RS
